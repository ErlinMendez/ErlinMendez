<h2 align="left">🛡️ About Me</h2>

<p align="justify">
I bring a risk-oriented mindset to cybersecurity, grounded in my background in Technology Risk, where I learned to evaluate controls, understand business impact, and identify gaps in processes and defenses. I connect how systems work, how attackers think, and how defenses fail. I’m currently developing strong Blue Team skills by building real-world threat hunts, analyzing logs, documenting investigations, and writing detection logic.</p>
